# halite2
My bot for halite2 competition organized by TwoSigma.

At the time of writing (January 27, 2018) bot was ranked 14 out of 5800 players and was in top-3 bots written in Python.
Bot's logic is put into MyBot.py file. Bot's code is left "as is" for historical purposes and just for fun. Time limit per turn was very generous (2000 milliseconds per turn) so bot is not really optimized for perfomance. Also code contains some functions that were not used in the final version.
